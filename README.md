# Pi_Collisions
I tried  recreating this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEfHFsfGXjs&amp;ab_channel=3Blue1Brown in python with pygame but I was unsuccessful. Sometimes it worked with specific initial velocities and masses but the GUI was not displaying anything coherent. I might complete it sometime in the future
